    "Some of the accuracy scores you've encountered thus far probably seem pretty impressive; an 80% accuracy seems pretty darn good on first try! What you have to keep in mind is that when predicting a binary classification, you are bound to be right sometimes, even just by random guessing. For example, a person should be roughly 50% accurate in guessing whether or not a coin lands on heads. This also can lead to issues when tuning models down the road. If you have a skewed dataset with rare events (such as a disease or winning the lottery) where there are only 2 positive cases in 1000, then even a trivial algorithm that classifies everything as 'not a member' will achieve an accuracy of 99.8% (998 out of 1000 times it was correct). So remember that an 80% accuracy must be taken into a larger context. AUC is an alternative comprehensive metric to confusion matrices, and ROC graphs allow us to determine optimal precision-recall tradeoff balances specific to the specific problem you are looking to solve.\n",

    "## The ROC curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The Receiver Operator Characteristic curve (ROC curve) which illustrates the true positive rate against false positive rate of our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already seen the True Positive Rate before, it's another name for recall! As a reminder, it's the ratio of the true positive predictions compared to all values that are actually positive. Mathematically, it is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{TPR} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP}+\\text{FN}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "False positive rate is the ratio of the false positive predictions compared to all values that are actually negative. Mathematically, it's represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{FPR} = \\frac{\\text{FP}}{\\text{FP}+\\text{TN}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a classifier, the best performing models will have an ROC curve that hugs the upper left corner of the graph. A classifier with 50-50 accuracy is deemed 'worthless'; this is no better then random guessing, as in the case of a coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/Image_144_ROC.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve gives us a graph of the tradeoff between this false positive and true positive rate. The AUC, or area under the curve, gives us a singular metric to compare these. An AUC of 1 being a perfect classifier, and an AUC of .5 being that which has a precision of 50%."

    "Another perspective to help understand the ROC curve is to think about the underlying model fueling our classification algorithm.

    "Here you see the majority of the two classes probabilities land at around .25 or .75. If we alter the cutoff point, it could sacrifice precision, increasing the false positive rate in order to also increase the true positive rate, or vice versa. Imagine in this instance that green is the positive case 1 (in this case heart disease) and red the negative case 0. Shifting the decision boundary to the left from 0.5 will result in capturing more of the positive (1) cases. At the same time, it will pick up some false positives, those red cases at the far right of the negative (0) case distribution that will be incorrectly identified as being part of the positive case distribution.\n",

Namely, the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) which graphs the False Positive Rate against the True Positive Rate. The overall accuracy of a classifier can thus be quantified by the AUC, the Area Under [this] Curve. Perfect classifiers would have an AUC score of 1.0 while and AUC of .5 is deemed trivial or worthless. Next, you're going to get more practice graphing the ROC and AUC curves and making interpretations based off of them."
